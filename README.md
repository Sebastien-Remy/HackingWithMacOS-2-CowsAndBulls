# 2-Cows and bulls

In this project we’re going to build a game called Cows and Bulls, in which players must enter a string of four numbers into a text field in an attempt to guess a hidden number. If one of their digits is in the correct place it’s a “bull”, if it exists in the hidden number but is in the wrong place it’s a “cow”. The hidden number doesn’t contain any duplicate digits.
For example, if the hidden number were 1234 and the player guess 1389, they would have one bull (“1” is in the correct place) and one cow (“3” is in the hidden number but in a different position.)
To make this game work in SwiftUI we’re going to use the @State property wrapper and List like you’ve seen before, but we’re also going to use several more really important views as you learn how to let the user enter text, click buttons, and more.”
